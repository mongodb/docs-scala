The {+driver-short+} provides the following classes that make it easier to use
the CRUD API:

- :ref:`scala-builders-filters`: Support for building query filters
- :ref:`scala-builders-projections`: Support for building projections
- :ref:`scala-builders-sorts`: Support for building sort criteria

.. TODO replace with links

- Aggregation: Support for building aggregation pipelines
- Updates: Support for building updates
- Indexes: Support for creating index keys

.. important::

   Builders make use of the ``Bson`` helper. This type, unlike the
   ``Document`` type, is not type-safe. Instead, conversion to BSON is
   done by using :driver:`Codecs and the CodecRegistry
   </java/sync/current/fundamentals/data-formats/codecs/>`.
